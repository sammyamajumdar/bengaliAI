## Classification model for Bengali handwritten digits.  


Deep Convolutional neural network is trained on more than 74K images of Bengali handwritten digits.  
The dataset is available on Kaggle at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/BengaliAI/numta  
Citation: https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02452  
Model accuracy on validation: ~97.4%  

### Context
Currently, natural language processing (NLP) research is developing rapidly due to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). One of the key topics of NLP is optical character recognition (OCR). To build an OCR in Bengali language, digit classification provides a convenient starting point. We have accumulated a large dataset (85,000+) of Bengali digits (NumtaDB) which can be used by researchers for benchmarking their algorithm.  

The dataset is a combination of six datasets that were gathered from different sources and at
different times. However, each of them was checked rigorously under the same evaluation
criterion so that all digits were at least legible to one human being without any prior knowledge.
Descriptions of these datasets including collection methodology, image segmentation and
extraction and image formats of these datasets are described in https://bengali.ai/datasets.
